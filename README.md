# Outty

## Project title: Outty

### Team members:
  *Vidya
  *Zach
  *Gurhar
  *Sam
  
### Vision statement: 
*App: Outdoor activity recommender
*It is often difficult when you are busy to formulate plans for outdoor activities. Normally you have to check the weather, search online for trails. Each outdoor activity you are considering is usually a separate search. An app that gathers all that information for you and gives you suggestions saves time and effort when you are too busy to figure out what your weekend adventure might be.
*So stop sitting at home, stop going to the gym, and start getting out! Our app helps our clients quickly pick an outdoor activity catered specifically to their outdoor profile that is weather and location appropriate. This app is your all-in-one guide to outdoor activities in your area. It doesn’t matter what your mood is or which outdoor activity you enjoy, this app has it all! 

### Motivation:
*It is something we all would use ourselves. Also, Each component/feature can be integrated separately allowing for incremental development. It is something that allows us to start small and build, meaning once we are able to get the basics working, there are a number of different enhancements/features that we can incorporate. In essence, it is a general idea that will allow us to focus on various enhancements as we move forward, which lends itself perfectly to agile development. Also because it’s a fun idea that makes planning outdoor activities more convenient.


### Risks to project completion, possibly including:
*Possible new language or working environment
*No prior experience working with these team members
*Unkown at present what best workflow will look like
*Bugs
*Unknown at present which api’s to use to make the process easier
*Unknown at present whether use of a frontend framework will be needed
*Unknown at present which backend to use
*Incredibly general topic, which may make it difficult to focus on direction at times

### Mitigation Strategy for above risks
*Weekly check ins on different stages to ensure on track with milestones for sprints
*Group text for quick easy communication and utilizing project tracking board
*Starting each feature early to allow for ample debugging time
*Find good apis
*Early prototyping may tell us whether we will need a frontend framework like react etc.
*Regular incremental commits and having tests in place parallel to development
*Organize file structure/code structure beforehand
*Creating a procedure to commit between different stages of codebase (for each merge into master)

### Development method:
*Regular scrum meetings. Scrum style - i.e. follow the agile development method, as presented in the textbook and lectures, as closely as possible. Our product will at least do something after sprint 0, and something better after sprint 1, etc. 
*Agile development with multiple sprints that each have their own milestones. We will also have weekly meetings where each team member will discuss what they did last week, what they plan to do this week and any impediments they have.
*Group text communication for quick planning and organization

### Project Tracking Software:
*Notion: notion is free for teams if we use our .edu email, we can use this to track task progress, as well as work on documentation collaboratively.
*Other project tracking tools may be brought in as needed.
